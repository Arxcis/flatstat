          <h3>🏅 Achievement: --wayland-with-fallback</h3>
          <p>Your app supports Wayland. Wayland supports isolation between apps. If the user is in a Wayland session,
            your app does not have access to x11. At the same time your app remains backwards-compatible with x11-users,
            giving x11-users access to the Flatpak ecosystem.</p>

        <article title="--x11">
          <h3>💥 Hole: --x11 </h3>
          <p>Your app supports x11. x11 does not support isolation between apps, which enables your app to see what a
            user is doing in other apps. E.g. keylogging, screen capture.</p>

        <article title="--filesystem-all">
          <h3>💥 Hole: --filesystem-all</h3>
          <p>Your app has blanket access to all of the user's private files, because it is using permissions like
            --filesystem=home or --filesystem=host</p>
        </article>
        <article title="--filesystem-unknown">
          <h3>💥 Hole: --filesystem-unknown</h3>
          <p>Your app has blanket access to one or more unknown files or directories - outside of "well-known
            directories" like xdg-desktop, xdg-music, etc.</p>

        <article title="--filesystem-well-known">
          <h3>💥 Hole: --filesystem-well-known</h3>
          <p>Your app has blanket access to one or more of the well-known directories - like xdg-desktop, xdg-music,
            etc. This is better than having access to unknown files or directories, or access to all files or
            directories, but is still considred a hole, because there is no isolation between apps.</p>
